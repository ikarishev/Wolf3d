Work in progress.
Attempting to utilize raycasting to create an outdoor world area using the 42-School's provided graphics library.

Finished:

  Smooth WASD movement.
  
  Skybox.
  
  Multiple textures to simulate outdoors.
  
 
 
Needs improvement:

  Rotation based on mouse movement. (minilibx doesn't seem to be able to lock the mouse to the
  
  center of the screen, so if the window is moved rotation might not work when mouse it at the
  
  edges of the computer screen.
  
  Collision detection turned off. (Teleports player back to center of map when he approaches outer
  
  bounds of the map)
  
  Texture resolution is at 64 x 64, Trivial to increase size, but as a demonstration this is enough.
  
  Also need to be re-drawn to enhance illusion of perspective.
    
  Skybox is super ugly.  
 
 
Planned:

  Sprite based enemies.
  
  Sprite based interactions with enemies.
  
  Destructible environment.
  
  Turn collision detection back on and include indoor parts of the map.
  
  Ground-fill.
